# Alchemist
Named after a John Finnemore sketch, this code attempts to use CNNs on stock and crypto data with the eventual goal of making money.

### Does it work?
Unforunately not. It also has no real interface - only tests. This is only a public repository because it's connected with a school project.

### Will it work?
Not in the near future, as I have been working on versions of this project for over a year and my most recent failure has put into perspective how little I've achieved (though I have learnt much). I have moved on to other projects for now.
